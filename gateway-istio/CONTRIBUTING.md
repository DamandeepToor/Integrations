# Contribute to gateway-istio
Contributions are welcome and much appreciated. Just follow these easy steps to contribute.

### Pull Requests
We welcome and encourage pull requests. When we get a pull request, it is peer reviewed. We'll provide updates and feedback throughout the process to keep you informed.

Follow these steps for pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. For any new golang code, add unit tests.
3. For configuration changes, if possible, add your efforts without changing existing defaults, but supply new optional behaviour
4. If you've changed semantics of the mixer, supply changed enforcement policy that conforms to the new semantics

## Bugs
We work hard to avoid them, but they still happen. Use GitHub issues to report bug and other issues.

### Known Issues
We also use GitHub issues for updates to known issues, including alerts when fixes are in progress.

### Reporting New Issues
Before filing a new issue, check Known Issues to see if your problem already exists. When reporting a new issue, provide as much detail as possible. The more information, the easier it is to debug and the faster you'll get a fix.

**Tips:**

* A description. What did you expect to happen? What actually happened? Why do you think the behavior was incorrect?
* Provide any logs or relevant output.
* A simple unit test or app that fails.
* What version are you running when reproducing issue? What was the last version that the feature worked?
* Anything else that seems relevant.
